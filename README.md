# GUI-system-for-infrared-small-target-detection
To promote the development of infrared small target detection technology, we have designed a human-computer interaction system based on a set of model driven algorithms and data driven algorithms, aiming to provide a benchmark platform for researchers to learn, compare, and jointly maintain and update.

The relevant code will be made public laterã€‚
